# GSoC 2022 Summary

I participated [Google Summer of Code 2022](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) as a contributor,
and I worked with Kevin Murphy on the [PyProbML] repo, which is used for the textbook 
"Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced Topics".

My work can be roughly separated into two parts.
In the first part, I wrote demos and short sections for the textbook.
In the second part, I mainly contribute to the ssm-jax package.

1. ## Work on the text book

In the first two months I mainly focused on the text book 

- Write demos Dirichlet process

- Write subsections on Variational inference of DP mixture model

2. ## Work on the ssm-jax package

This is packagte is about the state space models using jax.

- Write subsections on posteriror inference of state space models using 

- Linear Gaussian dynamics system using conjugate priors.

- Add learning algorithms for general LGSSM models.

## Summary

I am honored to work with Kevin this summer to contribute to the textbook the orginal version of which 
has influenced me a lot. It is also a wonderful experience to collaborate with all members in this project.
The advisors have always been very supportive and willing to help and the members are very enthusiastic.
